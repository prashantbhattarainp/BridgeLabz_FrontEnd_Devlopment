    <p>
      In the rapidly evolving world of technology, <mark>predictive policing</mark> is emerging as a powerful ally for law enforcement agencies. The <strong>Crime Hotspot Mapping and Predictive Portal</strong> combines data analytics and geospatial visualization to identify areas that may experience increased criminal activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Built using modern web technologies and machine learning models, this portal allows both authorities and the public to visualize real-time patterns. By analyzing historical data and trends, it helps predict <mark>potential hotspots</mark> before incidents occur — enabling proactive patrolling and better resource allocation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system integrates a dynamic heatmap powered by <strong>React + Leaflet</strong> and uses <em>Facebook Prophet</em> for time-series forecasting. Users can filter by crime type, region, or date to gain actionable insights into shifting patterns. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Our predictive model ensures better accuracy by continuously learning from new data. This reduces bias and improves transparency in the decision-making process. The result is a platform that not only enhances safety but also builds <mark>trust between citizens and law enforcement</mark>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "Predicting the future of crime is not about fear — it’s about foresight. We aim to empower communities through data, transparency, and prevention."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The next phase of the project aims to integrate AI-based sentiment analysis and social media monitoring to detect early signals of unrest. With continuous refinement, this portal stands as an example of how innovation and analytics can drive societal good.
